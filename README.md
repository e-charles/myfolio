# myfolio

Code is adapted from tradingview by dev named (Julien_Eche)... my version is the 
translation from pine to python with the help of grok since I do not have a deep knowledge 
of pine

Libraries: 
    pip install yfinance pandas numpy ta
    
Overview:
    the code evales a trading strategy based on SMA crossovers (buys when price crosses above SMA), 
    sell (when it crosses below). It calcs total trades, profit factor, win rate, robustness score to 
    identify the optimal SMA length 

Key comp:
    1. Data fetching: uses yfiance to download historical stock data 
    2. Robustness func: calc a score to eval the strategy performance 
    3. Backtest func: sims trades for a given SMA len 
    4. Optimization loop: tests multiple SMA lens and selects the best 
    5. Output: displays the optimal SMA len and performance metrics 


Trading strategy:
    Buy & Sell: opens long position on price crossover above SMA, closes long and 
    opens short position on crossunder, and vise versa 

    Long Only: opens long position on crossover, closses on crossunder 


Improvements suggested by Grok:
    1. Interactive Inputs: Replace hardcoded inputs with input() or a 
    GUI (e.g., tkinter) for ticker, dates, and strategy type.
    2. Table Display: Use tabulate or pandas to format the output as a table.
    3. Performance: Optimize the loop for fewer SMA lengths (e.g., range(10, 201, 10)) or parallelize with multiprocessing.
    4. Additional Metrics: Add metrics like max drawdown or Sharpe ratio for a more comprehensive evaluation.


for data science case study:
Goal: Maximize risk-adjusted returns of a momentum-based trading strategy for a specific stock or portfolio.

Step 1: Define the Strategy
    - Implement a momentum strategy that buys when the price is above a certain moving average and sells when below.
    - Key parameters to optimize: moving average length (e.g., 10-50 days) and threshold levels for entering/exiting trades.

Step 2: Collect and Prepare Data
    - Gather historical price data for the asset(s).
    - Clean data and calculate moving averages and other indicators as features.

Step 3: Backtesting and Performance Metrics
    - Test the strategy on historical data across different parameter values.
    - Evaluate performance using metrics such as total return, Sharpe ratio (risk-adjusted return), maximum drawdown, and win rate.
    - Consider transaction costs and slippage to simulate realistic trading.

Step 4: Optimization
    - Use grid search, random search, or more advanced methods like Bayesian optimization or genetic algorithms to find the parameter set that maximizes the Sharpe ratio.
    - Perform walk-forward testing: optimize on an in-sample period and test on a subsequent out-of-sample period to validate robustness and avoid overfitting.

Step 5: Validation and Robustness Checks
    - Test strategy across multiple market conditions (bull, bear, sideways).
    - Examine sensitivity to parameter changes.
    - Confirm that the strategy is not overfitted by checking consistent performance across different periods.

Step 6: Implementation and Monitoring
    - Deploy the optimized strategy in a paper trading or live environment.
    - Continuously monitor performance and adjust the strategy parameters dynamically as market conditions evolve.
